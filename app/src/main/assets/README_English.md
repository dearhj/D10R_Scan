  Note: Totinfo supports scanner setting query, and the current setting item is marked in all
  setting items
  Honeywell 2D does not support setting query, and when the setting command is sent successfully,
  there will be a corresponding command back to show the success or not

## Developer Notes

- Get the scan data by listening to the broadcast If you modify it to a custom broadcast
  in [Hard Decode Scan Tool], you need to modify it to the corresponding broadcast action and data

```kotlin
val intentFilter = IntentFilter()
val action = "com.android.serial.BARCODEPORT_RECEIVEDDATA_ACTION"
val data = "DATA"
intentFilter.addAction(action)
registerReceiver(object : BroadcastReceiver() {
    override fun onReceive(context: Context, intent: Intent) {
        if (action == intent.action) {
            val data = intent.getStringExtra(data)
            Log.d("scan", "scanQrCode = [${data}]")
        }
    }
}, intentFilter)
```

- Custom button listener Check the scanner configuration file in the device
  /vendor/etc/scanner_config.xml buttons node id is the name of the button openBroadcast trigger
  button Down
  closeBroadcast triggers button Up value = true the app will respond to the code,
  false the app will not respond to the code

```kotlin
val list = FileUtils.getBroadcastButton()
val buttonIntentFilter = IntentFilter()
buttonIntentFilter.addAction(list[0].openBroadcast)
buttonIntentFilter.addAction(list[0].closeBroadcast)
buttonIntentFilter.addAction("com.android.action.keyevent.KEYCODE_KEYCODE_SCAN_L_DOWN")
buttonIntentFilter.addAction("com.android.action.keyevent.KEYCODE_KEYCODE_SCAN_L_UP")
buttonIntentFilter.addAction("com.android.action.keyevent.KEYCODE_KEYCODE_SCAN_R_DOWN")
buttonIntentFilter.addAction("com.android.action.keyevent.KEYCODE_KEYCODE_SCAN_R_UP")
buttonIntentFilter.addAction("com.android.action.keyevent.KEYCODE_KEYCODE_SCAN_F_DOWN")
buttonIntentFilter.addAction("com.android.action.keyevent.KEYCODE_KEYCODE_SCAN_F_UP")
registerReceiver(object : BroadcastReceiver() {
    override fun onReceive(context: Context, intent: Intent) {
        if (list[0].openBroadcast == intent.action) {
            Log.d("scan", "${list[0].id} Button Press")
        } else if (list[0].closeBroadcast == intent.action) {
            Log.d("scan", "${list[0].id} Button Lift")
        }
    }
}, buttonIntentFilter)
```

- Send a scan broadcast to trigger a scan   
  Due to the diversity of devices, please test yourself to see if the following 3 broadcasts work

```kotlin
sendBroadcast(Intent("com.android.action.keyevent.KEYCODE_KEYCODE_SCAN_L_DOWN"))
sendBroadcast(Intent("com.android.action.keyevent.KEYCODE_KEYCODE_SCAN_R_DOWN"))
sendBroadcast(Intent("com.android.action.keyevent.KEYCODE_KEYCODE_SCAN_F_DOWN"))
```

## adb Simulated trigger scan

```markdown
adb shell am broadcast -a com.android.action.keyevent.KEYCODE_KEYCODE_SCAN_L_DOWN  
adb shell am broadcast -a com.android.action.keyevent.KEYCODE_KEYCODE_SCAN_R_DOWN  
adb shell am broadcast -a com.android.action.keyevent.KEYCODE_KEYCODE_SCAN_F_DOWN
```

## WebSocket trigger scan `ws://127.0.0.1:1234`

```markdown
  Continuous scan mode: send the string 'scan_start' to trigger the scan. If the scan is successful,
the scan result can be read directly from the socket. Send the string 'scan_stop' to end the
scan.   
Press scan button and release to stop mode: send the string 'scan_start' to trigger the scan. If
the scan is successful, you can read the result directly from the socket. Send the string '
scan_stop' to end the scan.     
Press sweep until result mode: send the scan_start string to trigger the sweep, if the sweep is
successful, the result can be read directly from the socket, no active end of sweep operation is
supported.
```

## Change the general settings through the webSocket

```markdown
  Send the string format settings: scanVoice=false,scanVibrate=false through the webSocket to turn
off the scan sound and the scan vibrate prompt.  
The latter can be combined and matched according to actual needs, where the format of the string
replacement setting is as follows: settings:charReplace=41=42&31=32&37=33 means replace the
character Ox41(A) with the character 0x42(B)
,replace the character Ox31(1) with the character 0x32(2),replace the character Ox37(7) with the
character 0x33(3).  
For more combinations, please refer to the table below.
```

## Broadcast to change the general settings.

```markdown
  The settings can be changed by broadcasting specific parameter values, for example, the following
examples indicate that the character Ox41(A) is replaced by the character 0x42(B), the character
Ox31(1) is replaced by the character 0x32(2), the character Ox37(7)
for 0x33(3)  
adb shell am broadcast -a com.android.action.change.scan.settings --es settings "
ReplaceChar=41=42&31=32&37=33"
  ```

The latter content can be combined and matched according to actual needs, please refer to the
following table for more combination items.
